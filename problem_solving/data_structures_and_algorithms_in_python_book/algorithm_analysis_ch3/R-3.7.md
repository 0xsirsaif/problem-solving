"""   
Show that the following two statements are equivalent:  
- (a) The running time of algorithm A is always O(f(n)).  
- (b) In the worst case, the running time of algorithm A is O(f(n)).  

"""   
The running time of algorithm A is always O(f(n)) means that at the worst case The Algorithm A is running at f(n) growth rate.  
in Big-O notion, we always work with the worst-case scenario cause of its simplicity to calculate as opposed to the challenges in the average case
