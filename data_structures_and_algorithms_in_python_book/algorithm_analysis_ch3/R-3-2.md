"""  
#### R-3.2  
The number of operations executed by algorithms A and B is (8nlog n)
and (2n^2), respectively. Determine such that A is better than B for n â‰¥ n0 .  
"""  
we say that Algorithm A is better than Algorithm B if the number of operations performed by A is less than B's operation
for all n >= n0.   

suppose that the base is 2

8nlogn <= 2n^2 (/8n)   
logn <= (1/4)n    
2^(logn) <= 2^(n/4)   
n <= 2^(n/4)   
n <= 4th_root(2^n)
n^4 <= 2^n

Answer is 16, where 2n^2 >= 8nlog n for all n >= 16
